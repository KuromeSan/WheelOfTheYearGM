WHATS THE WHEEL OF THE YEAR
âœ¨
a thread, because everyone is confused.

BASICALLY- 
"The Wheel of the Year" are old Celtic harvest festivals. 
as a result there frequently celebrated by Witches, pagans, Wiccans, etc

these are basically celebrations of the changing of seasons, I wont go into super detail since the ppl who would 
acturally want an app like this will already know all that anyway, plus theres nothing i can tell you that you wont find on 
the first result from google anyway soo yeah.


*May as well use this format now that its a meme, heck im more qualified too*
